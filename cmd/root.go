	Use:   "ws-ssh",
	Short: "A small program that forwards TCP connections over websockets",
	Long: `A small program that forwards TCP connections over websockets.
	
Can be very useful if you want to hide your SSH (or other pure TCP) server
behind Cloudflare or other CDN.

To use, on the server:
run
	ws-ssh listen --from 127.0.0.1:8822 --to 127.0.0.1:22
then add to nginx config:
	location /ws-ssh {
    	proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:8822/;
	}

On the client:
	ssh -o ProxyCommand="ws-ssh connect --url https://yoursite.com/ws-ssh stdio" yoursite.com
`,
	PreRun: util.LogConfig,
}

func Execute() {
	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.PersistentFlags().String("loglevel", "warn", "Logging severity level")
}
