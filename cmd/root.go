	Use:   "ws-ssh",
	Short: "A small program that forwards TCP connections over websockets",
	Long: `A small program that forwards TCP connections over websockets.
	
Can be very useful if you want to hide your SSH (or other pure TCP) server
behind Cloudflare or other CDN.

To use, on the server:
run
	ws-ssh listen --from 127.0.0.1:8822 --to 127.0.0.1:22
then add to nginx config:
	location /ws-ssh {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8822/;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
	}
and restart nginx for the changes to take effect

On the client:
	ssh -o ProxyCommand="ws-ssh connect --url https://yoursite.com/ws-ssh stdio" yoursite.com

It's also recommended to add frequent SSH keepalives to such connections:
	Host yoursite.com
		ServerAliveInterval 10
		ServerAliveCountMax 2

	PreRun: util.LogConfig,
}
